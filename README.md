# Challenge-1 HORISEON README

## Intoduction
This is the README for the first challenge of my coding bootcamp. This Repository contains an HTML and CSS file for the website for a fictional company called Horiseon. these files were supplied to me through a Gitlab repo so that the site's accessibility could be improved, so that a minor number of bugs could be fixed, and comments added to improve future work on these files, all without changing the site's end-user appearance.

## Things Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn how to work to modify a website to specific criteria, work with Github, practice HTML and CSS, and how to make a website more accessible for assistive technologies, like screen readers.
